### Network Security Projects for Phishing data


Main aim of this Machine Learning project is to create a model wherein whenever I get this specific dataset(i.e from features in the dataset) from a specific website, I need to predict whether the website is "fake" or whether it is "Malicious website" or not

This is our problem statement

Step-1
    We have the datset in our local machine, now we will create a ETL pipeline wherein we will read that dataset,do some transformation and finally convert it to a JSON, then we will insert the entire data into my MongoDB database(MongoDB atlas)
    Specifically MongoDB will be in cloud and Atlas actually provides some free account to create your MongoDB database and use them for some number of requests
